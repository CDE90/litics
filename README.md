# Litics

Litics is a web analytics tool that I'm building for my A level computer science project.

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.


## Notes

14/10/2023
- Initial commit with create-t3-app
- Added very basic data collecting script (didn't with with SPAs)
- Initial database schema with pageviews & sites (authentication stuff is already there)

15/10/2023
- Added basic API for getting pageviews
    - Checks if pageview exists, if not, creates it
    - Associates pageviews with user signatures (SHA-256 hash of user agent, IP, and hostname)
    - Checks if site exists, if not, creates it (this should be removed and added as UI. If a pageview event doesn't have a site associated, it should be ignored)
    - Handles locations with separate table
- Fix issue in testing script where CORS was causing issues
- Add screen size to API
- Big script overhauls
    - Adds new event for locationchange
    - Splits API with separate load, ping and exit event types
        - Allows duration to be tracked more accurately (server-side) becuase we can now set a session to hasEnded = true when the user leaves the page
    - Fix issue with exit payload sending current page data instead of previous page data (causing the pageview to be ended immediately)
    - Whenever a location change event fires, it will send a page exit event for the previous page and a page load event for the new page
        - The hashchange event also triggers a location change event
- Fixed bug with use of new Date().getSeconds() to get durations. This function returns a number 0-59 for the number of seconds past the minute, whereas for duration calculations I need the number of seconds from a fixed point. (changed to .getTime())
